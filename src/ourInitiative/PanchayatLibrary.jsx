                The commencement of a Panchayat Library and Learning Center in the remote mountainous village of Jalna, under the Kotabag Development Block, has been undertaken by the Sankalp Youth Foundation. 
                Through the Panchayat Library and Learning Center, the organization aims to not only provide access to books but also integrate various other educational activities alongside the library for children and the community, ensuring a continuous learning experience for children.
                The organization strives to ensure that books reach the last child of the mountains and that mountain children also have adequate opportunities for learning and understanding.
                Through the Panchayat Library and Learning Center, where free books are available to children, their parents, and the elderly of the village, efforts to develop a culture of reading among children and the community are taking tangible shape. 
                On the other hand, children are also getting opportunities to learn and understand through activities such as games, music, computer education, etc., along with books.
                Throughout the week, in addition to school hours, children are engaged in learning various subjects based on the weekly timetable at this Panchayat Library and Learning Center operated in the Panchayat building.
